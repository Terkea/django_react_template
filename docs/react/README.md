# React
## Introduction

This documentation will assume a fair knowledge of React as well as some of the tools that were used, including:

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design) as the webkit.
- [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
- [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react)

create the same directory structure and explain everything in each file?

or make docs more oriented towards completing a goal and not worrying about the boilerplate?
